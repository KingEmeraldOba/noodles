<h3>Descrption</h3>

<p>Hello everyone, how are you all doing?
My name is King Emerald and I am a Nigerian who live in Nigeria. I want to share my homemade Nigerian noodles (fried noodles) recipe with you guys. Please Enjoy.</p>

<p>Noodle is a fast food in Nigeria and a meal one can easily prepare when they are hungry. My favourite noodle is the Indomie Noodle. Indomie is a brand of instant noodle produced by the Indonesian company, Indofood.</p>

<p>However, Dufil Prima Foods PLC is the company in Nigeria with the franchise that produces Indomie.
Dufil is home to Nigeria's most loved noodle brand, Indomie Instant Noodles. Through consistent backward integration efforts over the past decade, Dufil has established itself as the leader in the instant noodles category. Dufil Group comprises of Dufil Prima Foods Plc.</p>
